# Named Entity Recognition (NER) Project

## Overview
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a subtask of Natural Language Processing (NLP) focused on identifying and categorizing named entities in text. 
These entities include categories such as persons, organizations, locations, dates, monetary values, and more. 
This project leverages modern NLP techniques to build and evaluate an NER system.
